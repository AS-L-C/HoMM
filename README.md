# High order Moments Models

We propose an alternative to classical attention that scales linearly with the number of tokens and is based on high order moments.


Currently testing on
- Vision: ImageNet classification
- Vision: Masked Auto Encoder pretraining

TODO:
- Vision: diffusion model
- NLP: sentence embedding
- NLP: next token prediction
